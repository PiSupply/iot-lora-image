# iot-lora-image
This Repository is targeted primarily to be used to track progress and releases over time for the SD Card Image & APT Packages.

As many changes between the SD Card image and Website Controller affect eachother it makes more sense to merge the issues into one repository rather than two. Allowing tracking of releases much easier.

# Version Numbers
Releases of the SD card image are planned to be done with the date they were compiled and released.
Project tracking is done based of a hopeful target release date.
